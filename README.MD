You and your friend play a game of cards. Each of you has thirty cards: ten 1's, ten 2's, and ten 3's. On each turn both you and your friend select a card to play out of the cards you have left. The higher card wins 1 point. No points are earned if equal cards were played.
If you know your opponents moves, it is easy to consistently win: play 1 when your friend plays 3, play 2 when your friend plays 1 and play 3 when your friend plays 2. This way you will win 20 points and your friend will only win 10.
Question: if you know that your friend always selects the card to play next uniformly at random, is there a strategy that yields a probability of winning over 1/2 (call this a winning strategy, in expectation)? Intuitively, knowing your friend's cards and consequently which card is most likely to be played next gives you similar knowledge as knowing your friend's move exactly. However, a quick calculation showed me that this intuition is flawed.
There is a straightforward dynamic programming algorithm to settle this question. This is what this package is for.
